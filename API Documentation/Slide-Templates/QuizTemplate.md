# Presentation Templates: Quiz.Slide

* `Quiz`
    * A Quiz Template that serves as a mix between a quick lesson-assessment & an opportunity to start a conversation around a particular topic.  This template is typically used back-to-back, the first time to pose the question and the second time to present the answer (Click the link for examples). Required components:
        * `Slide` - The required second-level component for creating presentations. Accepts internal components/props:
            * `Content` - The child second-level component that encases Typography components (`H1`-`H4`, `P`, etc.) and Media components
    Example: 
    ```jsx
        // Near the top of your Slides.js file
        import { H1, H2, H3, H4, Presentation, Span, } from 'lib/components'
        import { Text } from 'templates'

        const LESSON_NAME = "JavaScript Functions"

        // ... later, when you begin writing content for your lesson:
        export default () => (

                        <H3>Actually - we don't control the content at all!</H3>
                        <P>Most likely, our CDN keeps its content on many servers throughout the world. We neither own nor maintain it!</P>

                    <SpeakerNotes>
                        CDNs host very specific content most of the time. We don't control the content - it's a take it or leave it situation!
