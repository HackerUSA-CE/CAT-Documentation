# Issues

This page will walk you through what to do if you have an issue with CAT.

### Step One

Go through the [CAT issues](https://github.com/HackerUSA-CE/cat/issues) page and read the titles. If there is an issue that sounds **similar** to yours, please add your comment to that issue instead of filing a new issue. This allows the CAT developers to more efficiently escalate and solve problems. If you are unable to read through all of the issues, at least read through the issues filed in the last three months.
